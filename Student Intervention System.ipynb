The aim of the algorithm is to come up with a probabilistic function during training.It does this by taking features about previous students like their age,gender and creates a model whilst assigning \"weights\" to these features that assess the importance of each feature in predicting the final outcome of passed or failed.When we want to predict an outcome for a new student , we take the new student's features and combine them with the \"weights\" previously assigned to them during training and then a final summed up value is applied to a function (called a \"sigmoid\") that then predicts the whether the student will pass or fail."
